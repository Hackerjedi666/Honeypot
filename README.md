# Honeypot
A SSH Honeypot for DTI project


SSH (Secure Shell) is a widely used protocol for secure remote access to servers and other network devices. However, SSH is also a frequent target of attacks, including brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other password guessing attacks. One way to detect and analyze SSH attacks is by using SSH honeypots, which are decoy servers that are designed to attract attackers and capture their activities. In this paper, we present a study on SSH honeypots, including the design, deployment, and analysis of a SSH honeypot. We also present the results of our analysis, which includes an overview of the types of SSH attacks, the geographical distribution of attackers, and the methods used by attackers to try to gain access to SSH servers.
